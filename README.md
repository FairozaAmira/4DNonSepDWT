# 4D Non-Separable Integer Wavelet Transform
My Ph.D Dissertation project

This repository is a compilation of codes from the papers:

"Non-separable four-dimensional integer wavelet transform with reduced rounding noise" published in Signal Processing: Image Communication journal on Oct. 2017.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.image.2017.07.003

"Reduction of rounding noise and lifting steps in non-separable four-dimensional quadruple lifting integer wavelet transform" published in EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s13640-018-0271-0

and a part of this was presented in IEEE Int. Conf. on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing 2017.

This project is a part of my Ph.D Dissertation which entitled, "Non-separable Integer Wavelet Transform 4D Medical Image Compression".
